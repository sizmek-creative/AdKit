This is a 360 component sample workspace.
Because the 360 component uses a canvas element, browsers has restrictions that prevents it from working in file mode.

In order to preview the workspace on your local machine, you can use Chrome browser.
But you first need to enable this flag:

--allow-file-access-from-files

To make things easy, we created a launcher for Chrome.
In order to use it, do the following:

1. You must have Chrome browser installed and make sure it's not open when using the launcher (*** important ***).
2. Open the launcher file. 'preview' for MAC and 'preview.bat' for windows.
